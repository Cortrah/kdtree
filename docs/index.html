    I chose a kdtree from http://rosettacode.org/wiki/K-d_tree
</p>
<p>

    I'd like to do this in elixir, but in order to get it done by wednessday I decided to coble together something using
    an ancient binary search tree that I wrote in actionscript in 2000
    https://cortrah.github.io/kdtree/archive/flash/flash_things.htm
</p>
<p>

    And use it to augment an implementation by ubilabs that used a binary heap instead of a binary search tree as the
    data structure.
</p>
<p>

    This is the readme for the ubilabs version
    https://github.com/ubilabs/kd-tree-javascript
</p>
<p>

    Their examples are particularly great for getting the sense of what a kdtree is, I love the color picker example.
</p>
<p>

    Another good description of the use of a kdtree applied specifically to 3d rendering via binary space partitioning

    Also two great books that really get into this stuff
