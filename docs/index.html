# kdtree

A code kata for the agnostechvalley user group.
https://www.meetup.com/agnostechvalley/events/237797340/

I chose a kdtree from http://rosettacode.org/wiki/K-d_tree

I'd like to do this in elixir, but in order to get it done by wednessday I decided to coble together something using an ancient binary search tree that I wrote in actionscript in 2000
https://cortrah.github.io/kdtree/docs/archive/flash/flash_things.htm

And use it to augment an implementation by ubilabs that used a binary heap instead of a binary search tree as the data structure.

This is the readme for the ubilabs version
https://github.com/ubilabs/kd-tree-javascript

Their examples are particularly great for getting the sense of what a kdtree is, I love the color picker example.

Another good description of the use of a kdtree applied specifically to 3d rendering via binary space partitioning

Also two great books that really get into this stuff
