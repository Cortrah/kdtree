Just included for any trivia buffs

The flash4 stuff was created in 1998 so that I'd have a few basic datastructures to work with when doing programmatic animation

At the time you didn't even have arrays in actionscript, flash was just an animation tool.

The flash5 binary search tree was created in 2000 when they added nearly complete javascript support (no regular expressions and no access to the http headers without calling out through the plugin api to the browser)
